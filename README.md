* Building a CNN architecture
* Training and validation of the model
* Evaluating accuracy on the test set
* Visualizing sample predictions

### Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

### How to Run

1. Install the required libraries
2. Open the notebook
3. Run all cells in order

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a **clear and beginner-friendly example** of how CNNs are applied to image classification problems using a well-known benchmark dataset.
